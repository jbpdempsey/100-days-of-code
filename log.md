# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: November 27, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started freecodecamp.org. Completed first 3 lessons of the 'Front End Development Course' (HTML5 & CSS, Responsive Design with Bootstrap and jQuery)

**Thoughts:** HTML and CSS make sense to me but remembering the exact notation is tricky without going back to examples

**Link to work:** freecodecamp.org

### Day 2: November 28, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Built a tribute page whilst working on Basic Front End Development Projects at freecodecamp

**Thoughts:** I decided to not waste too much time getting everything perfect (centering the list in the column exactly how I wanted it was hard). But I focused on passing the requirements in the simplest way.

Completed up to 'Escape Sequences in Strings' in the javascript course on FCC. Really enjoying JS and can see the value in it.

### Day 3: November 29, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Working through Javascript the Javascript lessons on FCC (bracket notation)

**Thoughts:** having a decent matchs background is helping, the logic is quite clear

### Day 2: November 28, 2017

**Today's Progress**: More CSS work. I used https://codepen.io/simonmoon/pen/bfrwo to create a triple Venn diagram of Product Management in codepen

**Thoughts:** Taking the original code and reserve engineering it was a good way to work out which bits controlled which. Then some parts weren't what I wanted as they weren't intended for my use so I used a lot of google tabs to (W3 Schools) to find better solutions. still feels a bit hacky but the end result is good

A bit more javascript work on FCC
